OMNR stable isotope data

Data file "data4_no_location_details" includes SI data funded by the University of Guelph and the University of Toronto in collaboration with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources' Broadscale Monitoring (BsM) program. This file was created using R code that combined Master isotope data files from three separate isotope projects from 2008-2018

Personal note: data4-no_location_details is the same as my data4.csv file, but has lake names and location columns removed.
